# The Jensen Lab  
**Department of Medicine – Division of Cardiology**  
**University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill**

The Jensen Lab investigates the molecular and pathophysiological mechanisms of heart failure using both in vitro and in vivo models. Our research is informed by clinical insights from Dr. Brian Jensen’s work as an advanced heart failure cardiologist, allowing for a uniquely translational approach that bridges basic science with clinical application.

We focus on the cellular and molecular processes that underlie cardiac dysfunction, including mitochondrial regulation, adrenergic receptor signaling, and the cardiovascular consequences of targeted cancer therapies. We also examine the role of nuclear receptor signaling in cardiac physiology and disease.

Our laboratory collaborates extensively across departments and schools at UNC, including Pharmacology, Biology, Cell Biology and Physiology, Biomedical Engineering, the Eshelman School of Pharmacy, and the Gillings School of Global Public Health.
